## (Intro) 
 - BACE-Net implements cartesian ACE derived starting from standard Behler-Parrinello symmetry fucntions. It includes body-order and linear-scaling benefits of ACE with the expressive power of neural networks and learnable species embeddings.

## Features:
 - Standard short range model
 - charge equilibration similar to that presented in [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-024-01225-6]
 - multi-shell polarizable charge equilibration model for insulators and ferroelectric materials
 - In the case of charge equilibration, the we have implemented conjugate gradient to enable large systems simulations withing ASE.
